# Author: Shawn Ravi
# Dataset: Standard Iris Dataset
# Task-2 : Predicting the optimum Number of Clusters for the given dataset

# Importing required libraries:
library(utils)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(stats)
library(datasets)


# Importing dataset from the source:
data(iris)

# To find the summary of the columns in the dataset:
summary(iris) 

# To know the structure of the dataset:
str(iris)


# Within Sum of Squares (WSS):
#-----------------------------

# Compute clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering) for different values of k.

# For instance, by varying k from 1 to 10 clusters, for each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of square (wss). 

# Plot the curve of wss according to the number of clusters k.

# The location of a bend (knee) in the plot is generally considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters.

# Compute and plot wss for k = 2 to k = 10

m <- 10 # Maximum number of clusters

data <- iris[1:4] # Selecting the numerical columns from the dataset

wss <- sapply(1:m,function(k){kmeans(data, k, nstart=50 )$tot.withinss}) #Applying Kmeans for K=1 to K=10

# Plotting the graph of wss:
#---------------------------

plot(1:m, wss,type="b", xlab="Number of clusters K",ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")

abline(v = 3, lty =3) # Verifies that the location of knee in the plot is at K=3
